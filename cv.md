### About Myself

I work in the medical university at the department of information technologies. 
My main responsibility include managing a resource built on the CMS Moodle system
where our students doing their control and training tests.
I usually work with the programs like MS Word, MS Excel, PowerPoint and others.
But I love programming and want to improve my knowledges I already have.
My main goal is to become a Web Developer.
So I took this case in my hands and spent a lot of time learning English and
programming languages (Java and JavaScript).
